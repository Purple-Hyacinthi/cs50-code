Part 1: Audio Atmosphere Characteristics of the Audience
Calculation Results
Based on 100 songs in the "songs. dB" database, calculate and report the average values of three audio features:
Average energy value (energy): SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs;
Average emotional value (valence): SELECT AVG(valence) FROM songs;
Average dance value (danceability): SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM songs;

Aesthetic Feature Description
Based on the two features that deviate most significantly from the neutral value of 0.5, two emotional words are used to describe the audio atmosphere:
The audio atmosphere of this listener can be described as: "[Emotion corresponding to Feature 1] and [Emotion corresponding to Feature 2]"
(Example: If the energy is at its peak and the emotional value is the second highest → "Full of energy and happiness")

Part Two: Reflection and Improvement Plan
Defects of the Current Method
• The average value masks the emotional fluctuations between songs (for example, intense songs and calm songs cancel each other out)
• The actual playback frequency is not taken into account (single song loops and songs listened only once have the same weight)
• Feature combinations are ignored (such as "melancholic dance music" which combines low emotion and high danceability is treated separately)
Improvement plan
Weighted by playback count:
• Calculation method: SUM(feature value × playback count) / Total playback count
• Advantage: More closely reflects real listening habits, highlighting the influence of frequently listened songs
2. Emotional Clustering Analysis Method:
• Calculation Method: Group songs based on all features and select the two clusters with the highest proportion of emotions.
• Advantages: Captures complex emotional combinations and identifies mixed atmospheres
